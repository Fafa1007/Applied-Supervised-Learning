### Numerical Features

1.  **Administrative**:

    -   **Description**: The number of pages visited by the user related to account management (e.g., login, account settings).

    -   **Intuition**: Users who visit more administrative pages might be more engaged or returning users, which could indicate a higher likelihood of purchasing.

2.  **Administrative Duration**:

    -   **Description**: The total time (in seconds) spent by the user on administrative pages.

    -   **Intuition**: Spending more time on administrative tasks might indicate a user who is serious about their account, possibly preparing to make a purchase.

3.  **Informational**:

    -   **Description**: The number of pages visited by the user related to website information (e.g., FAQs, contact info).

    -   **Intuition**: Users visiting informational pages might be gathering information before making a decision, which could indicate intent to purchase.

4.  **Informational Duration**:

    -   **Description**: The total time (in seconds) spent by the user on informational pages.

    -   **Intuition**: Spending more time on informational pages might indicate a user who is researching the site or products, which could be a precursor to purchasing.

5.  **Product Related**:

    -   **Description**: The number of product-related pages visited by the user (e.g., product details, reviews).

    -   **Intuition**: Users who view more product-related pages are likely more interested in purchasing, as they are actively exploring products.

6.  **Product Related Duration**:

    -   **Description**: The total time (in seconds) spent by the user on product-related pages.

    -   **Intuition**: Spending more time on product pages suggests a higher interest in the products, which could lead to a purchase.

7.  **Bounce Rate**:

    -   **Description**: The **bounce rate** is the percentage of visitors who land on a page (usually the entry page) and leave the site **without interacting further** (e.g., without clicking on any other pages or triggering any additional requests to the server)

    -   **Intuition**: A high bounce rate might indicate disinterest or dissatisfaction, while a low bounce rate suggests engagement.

8.  **Exit Rate**:

    -   **Description**: The **exit rate** is the percentage of users who leave the site **after viewing a specific page**, regardless of whether they interacted with other pages before that.

    -   **Intuition**: A high exit rate might indicate that users are leaving the site after viewing certain pages, which could signal a lack of interest or intent to purchase.

9.  **Page Value**:

    -   **Description**: The average value of the pages visited by the user before completing a transaction. This metric is provided by Google Analytics.

    -   **Intuition**: Pages with higher values are more likely to lead to a purchase, so users visiting high-value pages might have a higher purchasing intent.

10. **Special Day**:

    -   **Description**: Indicates how close the visit date is to a special day (e.g., Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day). The value ranges from 0 (not close to a special day) to 1 (on a special day).

    -   **Intuition**: Users are more likely to make purchases close to special days, so this feature helps capture seasonal purchasing behavior.

### Categorical Variables

1.  **Month**:

    -   **Description**: The month in which the visit occurred.

    -   **Intuition**: Purchasing behavior might vary by month due to seasonal trends, holidays, or promotions.

2.  **OperatingSystems**:

    -   **Intuition**: Different operating systems might correlate with different user behaviors or purchasing patterns.

3.  **Browser**:

    -   **Description**: The browser used by the visitor (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

    -   **Intuition**: Browser choice might influence user experience, which could affect purchasing behavior.

4.  **VisitorType**:

    -   **Intuition**: Returning visitors are more likely to make purchases compared to new visitors.

5.  **Weekend**:

    -   **Description**: Indicates whether the visit occurred on a weekend (1) or a weekday (0).

    -   **Intuition**: Users might have more time to browse and shop on weekends, which could affect purchasing behavior.

    -   **Intuition**: This is the label used to train the model to predict purchasing intention.
